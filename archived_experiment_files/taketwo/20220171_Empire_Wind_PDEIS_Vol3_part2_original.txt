17	Empire Offshore Wind Appendix M Draft Environmental Impact Statement Seascape, Landscape, and Visual Impact Assessment The seascape character units, landscape character units, and viewer experiences would be affected by the Proposed Action's noticeable features, applicable distances and FOV extents, open views versus view framing and intervening foregrounds, and form, line, color, and texture contrasts, scale of change, and prominence in the characteristic seascape and landscape. Higher impact levels would stem from unique, extensive, and long-term appearance of strongly contrasting, large, and prominent vertical structures in the otherwise horizontal seascape environment; where structures are an unexpected element and viewer experience is of formerly open views of high-sensitivity seascape and landscape; and from high sensitivity view receptors. Construction involving moving and stationary visual feature contrasts to forms, lines, colors, and textures, scale, and prominence in formerly open seascape may have more effect on viewers than operational and decommissioning impacts, where the viewing context is existing WTGs and substations. Construction impacts would be temporary and include: cent Daytime and nighttime movement of installation vessels, cranes, and other equipment visible in the seascape in and around the Lease Area; cent Dawn, dusk, and nighttime construction lighting on WTGs and OSS; cent Beach, other sensitive land-based, and boat and cruise ship views of WTGs and OSS under construction; cent Laying of the offshore and onshore buried export cables and the connections between offshore and onshore export cables at high-sensitivity Island Beach State Park and Ocean City beach landing sites; and cent Activities along the onshore landfalls, export cable routes, and BL England and Oyster Creek onshore substations. Operational effects would be similar to those of end-stage construction and would be long term and fully reversible. Proposed Action impacts on high-sensitivity seascape character would be major. The daytime and nighttime (lighting) presence of the WTGs, OSS, and construction and O&M vessel traffic would change perception of this area from natural, undeveloped seascape to a developed wind energy environment characterized by visually dominant WTGs and OSS. Maintenance activities would cause minor effects on seascape character by increased O&M vessel traffic to and from the Wind Farm Development Area. Increases in these vessel movements would be noticeable to offshore viewers but are unlikely to have a significant effect. Decommissioning would involve the removal of all offshore structures and is expected to follow the reverse of the construction activity. Decommissioning activities would cause effects similar to those of construction activities. Viewshed analyses (COP Volume 3, Appendix AA; Empire 2022) determined that clear-weather visibility of the WTGs and OSS would occur from 12.5 percent of the land area within the Proposed Action's zone of visual influence. The Proposed Action would be visible along the barrier islands' southern beaches. The majority of landward visibility (155 square miles) would occur within 14.2-28 miles of the Proposed Action over inland bays. Visibility would diminish between 28 and 40 miles, contributing 44 square miles to the zone of visual influence. Elevated viewing conditions, such as would occur at the Fire Island Lighthouse (160 feet [48.5 meters]), Sandy Hook Lighthouse (108 feet [32.9 meters]), and Empire State Building (1,304 feet [397.5 meters]), would increase WTG visibility distances M-11
18	Empire Offshore Wind Appendix M Draft Environmental Impact Statement Seascape, Landscape, and Visual Impact Assessment to as much as 42 miles (67.6 kilometers). Due to coastal meteorological conditions, Proposed Action visibility in these areas would be noticeably reduced on approximately 3 days out of 4 to 5 days. Daytime lighting of WTGs is not required. ADLS would reduce nighttime impact levels from major to moderate or moderate to minor, due to substantially limited hours of lighting. Residual impacts would result from the presence of continuously flashing lights, sky light dome, and reflections on clouds during those limited hours. Lights of the two OSS, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for the safety of O&M personnel, potentially would be visible from beaches and adjoining land and built environment during hours of darkness. The nighttime sky light dome and cloud lighting caused by reflections from the water surface may be seen from distances beyond the 40-mile (64.4- kilometer) geographic analysis area, depending on variable ocean surface and meteorological reflectivity. Onshore substations' nighttime lighting would be visible in their immediate neighborhoods during hours of darkness and similar in magnitude and extent to existing conditions.
