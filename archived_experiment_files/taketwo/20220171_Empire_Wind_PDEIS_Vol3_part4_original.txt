There would be a slight difference in contrasts between Alternative B and the Proposed Action due to alteration of the turbine array layout. Table M-17 and Table M-18 list Alternative B wind farm width-, height-, and distance-related occupation of views from the nearest shoreline area. Distance and FOV comparisons with the Proposed Action indicate similar effects, varying by 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) and the horizontal FOVs would vary by 3. The vertical FOVs would vary by less than 1 (0.1 variation) of the viewer FOV. These results indicate slight changes to the FOV results compared to the Proposed Action (Table M-3 and Table M-4). Table M-17 Horizontal FOV Occupied by Alternative B Noticeable Width1 Distance2 Horizontal Percent of Human FOV Element miles (km) miles (km) FOV FOV WTGs 22.5 (36.2) 14.1 (22.7) 57.9 124 47% 1 Maximum extent of the wind farm array. 2 Nearest onshore distance to the wind farm array. km = kilometers Table M-18 Vertical FOV Occupied by Alternative B Height Visible Noticeable Distance Vertical Human Percent feet (m) Height1 Element miles (km) FOV FOV of FOV MLLW feet (m) Rotor Blade Tip 951 (289.9) 14.1 (22.7) 865 (264) 0.6 55 1% 1 Based on intervening EC, clear-day, and clear-night conditions. km = kilometers; m = meters M.3.2.1. Conclusion The effects of Alternative B on seascape character, open ocean character, landscape character, and viewer experience would be similar to the effects of the Proposed Action. Due to distance, extensive FOVs, high view prominence, strong contrasts, and heretofore undeveloped ocean views, Alternative B would have major effects on the open ocean unit character and viewer boating and cruise ship experiences. Due to view distances, moderate FOVs, moderate and weak visual contrasts, clear-day conditions, and nighttime ADLS activation, effects of Alternative B on high- and moderate-sensitivity landscape character units would be moderate to major. The daytime presence of offshore WTGs and OSS, as well as their nighttime lighting, would change perception of ocean scenes from natural and undeveloped to a developed wind energy environment characterized by WTGs and OSS. In clear weather, the WTGs and OSS would be an unavoidable presence in views from the coastline, with moderate to major effects on landscape character. Considering all the IPFs together, BOEM anticipates that the contribution of Alternative B to the impacts associated with ongoing and planned activities in combination with other future offshore wind development would be major. The main drivers for this impact rating are the major visual impacts associated with the presence of offshore structures, lighting, and vessel traffic. M-25
32	Empire Offshore Wind Appendix M Draft Environmental Impact Statement Seascape, Landscape, and Visual Impact Assessment M.3.3 Impacts of Alternative E on Scenic and Visual Resources The effects of Alternative E on seascape character, open ocean character, landscape character, and viewer experience would be similar to the effects of the Proposed Action. Alternative E would alter the turbine array layout compared to the Proposed Action; however, Alternative E would allow for installation of up to 147 WTGs as defined in Empire's PDE. Table M-19 and Table M-20 list Alternative E wind farm width-, height-, and distance-related occupation of views from the nearest shoreline area. Distance and FOV comparisons would be the same as those of the Proposed Action. The vertical FOVs would be the same as for the Proposed Action. Impacts of Alternative E related to the primary IPFs (presence of structures, lighting, vessel traffic, land disturbance, and accidental releases) would be similar to the impacts described for the Proposed Action. The seascape character units, open ocean character unit, landscape character units, and viewer experience would be affected by construction, O&M, and decommissioning of Alternative E due to the noticeable elements, distance effects, FOV extents, view framing and intervening foregrounds, prominence, and contrast rating. Horizontal and vertical FOV extents (Table M-19 and Table M-20) of the Alternative E wind farm would be the same as for the Proposed Action (Table M-3 and Table M-4).

The main drivers for this impact rating are the major visual impacts associated with the presence of offshore structures, lighting, and vessel traffic. M.3.4 Impacts of Alternative F on Scenic and Visual Resources Table M-21 and Table M-22 list Alternative F wind farm width-, height-, and distance-related occupation of views from the nearest shoreline area. Distance and FOV comparisons with the Proposed Action indicate similar effects, varying by 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) and the horizontal FOVs would vary by 3. The vertical FOVs would vary by less than 1 of the viewer FOV. These results indicate slight changes to the FOV results compared to the Proposed Action (Table M-3 and Table M-4). Impacts of Alternative F related to the primary IPFs (presence of structures, lighting, vessel traffic, land disturbance, and accidental releases) would be similar to the impacts described for the Proposed Action.

Alternative F would alter the turbine array layout compared to the Proposed Action; however, Alternative F would allow for installation of up to 147 WTGs as defined in Empire's PDE. Horizontal and vertical FOV extent (Table M-21 and Table M-22) differences between Alternative F and the Proposed Action (Table M-3 and Table M-4) would not be noticeable to the casual viewer at applicable seascape receptor distances to the WTG array.

The main drivers for this impact rating are the major visual impacts associated with the presence of offshore structures, lighting, and vessel traffic. M.3.5 Impacts of Alternatives C, D, G, and H on Scenic and Visual Resources Alternatives C, D, and G involve selection of specific submarine export cable or onshore export cable routes to avoid impacts on federally maintained anchorage area (Alternative C-1), navigation channel (Alternative C-2), or sand borrow areas (Alternative D), or use a cable bridge to cross Barnums Channel (Alternative G). Alternative H would use a method of dredge or fill activities (clamshell dredging with environmental bucket) that would reduce the discharge of dredged material compared to other dredging options considered in the Empire Wind PDE (i.e., open cut trenching/jetting, suction hopper dredging, hydraulic dredging). None of these alternatives would add or modify above-water or aboveground infrastructure included in the PDE for the Proposed Action and impacts of Alternatives C, D, G, or H on scenic and visual resources would be the same as described for the Proposed Action. Impacts of Alternatives C, D, G, or H related to the primary IPFs (presence of structures, lighting, vessel traffic, and accidental releases) would also be similar to the impacts described for the Proposed Action. M.3.5.1. Conclusions The effects of Alternatives C, D, G, or H on seascape character, open ocean character, landscape character, and viewer experience would be similar to the effects of the Proposed Action. Due to distance, extensive FOVs, high view prominence, strong contrasts, and heretofore undeveloped ocean views, Alternatives C, D, G, or H would have major effects on the open ocean unit character and viewer boating and cruise ship experiences. Due to view distances, moderate FOVs, moderate and weak visual contrasts, clear-day conditions, and nighttime ADLS activation, effects of Alternatives C, D, G, or H on high- and moderate-sensitivity seascape character units would be moderate to major.

M.3.6 Impacts of the Connected Action on Scenic and Visual Resources View distances, facility scale, view prominence, and visual contrasts (form, line, color, and texture comparisons) of characteristics of the seascape and landscape before and after implementation of the SBMT staging facility are indicated in Table M-5.
