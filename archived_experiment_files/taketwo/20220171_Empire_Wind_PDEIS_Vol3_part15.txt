BOEM shall review the objection and may notify the other signatories as appropriate, and respond to the objector. XIV. AMENDMENTS A. This MOA may be amended when an amendment is agreed to in writing by all signatories and invited signatories. The amendment will be effective on the date a copy signed by all of the signatories and invited signatories is filed with the ACHP. B. Revisions to any attachment may be proposed by any signatory or invited signatory by submitting a draft of the proposed revisions to all signatories and invited signatories with a notification to the consulting parties. The signatories and invited signatories will consult for no more than 30 calendar days (or another time period agreed upon by all signatories and invited signatories) to consider the proposed revisions to the attachment. If the signatories and invited signatories unanimously agree to revise the attachment, BOEM will provide a copy of the revised attachment to the other signatories, invited signatories, and consulting parties. Revisions to any attachment to this MOA will not require an amendment to the MOA. XV. TERMINATION If any signatory or invited signatory to this MOA determines that the terms of this MOA will not or cannot be carried out, the signatory or invited signatory shall immediately consult with the other signatories, invited signatories, and consulting parties to attempt to develop an amendment per Stipulation XIV. If within 30 calendar days (or another time period agreed to by all signatories) an amendment cannot be reached, any signatory or invited signatory may terminate the MOA upon written notification to the other signatories. Once the MOA is terminated, and prior to work continuing on the undertaking, BOEM must either(a) execute an MOA pursuant to 36 CFR 800.6 or (b) request, take into account, and respond to the comments of the ACHP under 36 CFR 800.7. BOEM shall notify the signatories and invited signatories as to the course of action BOEM will pursue. XVI. COORDINATION WITH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES A. In the event that another federal agency not initially a party to or subject to this MOA receives an application for funding/license/permit for the undertaking as described in this MOA, that agency may fulfill the agency's Section 106 responsibilities by stating in writing that the agency concurs with the terms of this MOA and notifying the signatories and invited signatories that the agency intends to do so. Such federal agency may become a signatory, invited signatory, or a concurring party (collectively referred to as signing party) to the MOA as a means of complying with the agency's responsibilities under Section 106 and based on the agency's level of involvement in the undertaking. To become a signing party to the MOA, the agency official must provide written notice to the signatories and invited signatories that the agency agrees to the terms of the MOA, specifying the extent of the agency's intent to participate in the MOA. The participation of the agency is subject to approval by the signatories and invited signatories who must respond to the written notice within 30 calendar days or the approval will be considered implicit. Any necessary amendments to the MOA as a result will be considered in accordance with the Amendment Stipulation (Stipulation XIV). 22
153	B. Should the signatories and invited signatories approve the federal agency's request to be a signing party to this MOA, an amendment under Stipulation XIV will not be necessary if the federal agency's participation does not change the undertaking in a manner that would require any modifications to the stipulations set forth in this MOA. BOEM will document these conditions and involvement of the federal agency in a written notification to the signatories, invited signatories, and consulting parties, and include a copy of the federal agency's executed signature page, which will codify the addition of the federal agency as a signing party in lieu of an amendment. XVII. ANTI-DEFICIENCY ACT Pursuant to 31 USC 1341(a)(1), nothing in this MOA will be construed as binding the United States to expend in any one fiscal year any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for this purpose, or to involve the United States in any contract or obligation for the further expenditure of money in excess of such appropriations. Execution of this MOA by BOEM, the New Jersey SHPO, New York SHPO, and the ACHP, and implementation of the terms of this MOA evidence that BOEM has taken into account the effects of the undertaking on historic properties and afforded the ACHP an opportunity to comment.
