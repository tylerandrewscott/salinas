Table M-12 lists impacts on viewer experience at each of these KOPs. M.3.6.1. Conclusions Due to nearness of view distances, large scale, high view prominence, and moderate to strong contrasts, the SBMT staging facility would have moderate to major effects on the seascape unit character, minor effects on the landscape character unit, and moderate to major effects on viewer experience. The daytime presence of moving and stationary cranes, storage and transfer of WTG components, moving and stationary barges and ships, and associated nighttime lighting would be moderately to strongly contrasting with the seascape. In clear weather, the SBMT staging facility would be an unavoidable presence in views from the water and from onshore sea level and elevated viewing locations, with moderate to major effects on seascape character. Considering all the IPFs together, BOEM anticipates that the contribution of the SBMT staging facility activities to the impacts associated with ongoing and planned activities in combination with other future offshore wind development would be major. The main drivers for this impact rating are the major visual impacts associated with the presence of onshore equipment and WTGs, lighting, and offshore vessel traffic. M.4. SLIA Summary SLIA considers resource sensitivity, susceptibility, and magnitude of change in the impacts on the physical elements and features that make up a seascape, open ocean, or landscape and the aesthetic, perceptual, and experiential aspects of the seascape, open ocean, or landscape that contribute to the area's distinctive character. These impacts affect the "feel," "character," or "sense of place" of an area of seascape, open ocean, or landscape. Table M-23 summarizes the effects of the character of the offshore and onshore components of the Projects with the aspects that contribute to the distinctive character of the seascape, open ocean, and landscape areas from which the Projects would be visible (BOEM 2021).

Empire Offshore Wind Appendix N Draft Environmental Impact Statement Finding of Adverse Effect for Empire Wind COP Appendix N. Finding of Adverse Effect for the Empire Wind Construction and Operations Plan November, 2022 BOEM has made a Finding of Adverse Effect under Section 106 of the NHPA pursuant to 36 CFR 800.5 for the Empire COP. BOEM finds that the undertaking would adversely affect the following historic properties: cent 30 marine archaeological resources (Section N.4.1.1.1) cent 22 ancient submerged landforms with archaeological or TCP potential (Section N.4.1.1.2) cent 16 architectural resources (Section N.4.1.3): o West Bank Light Station in Staten Island, New York o Breezy Point Surf Club Historic District in Gateway National Recreation Area, Rockaway, Queens, New York (National Park Service) o Silver Gull Beach Club Historic District in Gateway National Recreation Area, Rockaway, Queens, New York (National Park Service) o Jacob Riis Park Historic District in Gateway National Recreation Area, Rockaway, Queens, New York (National Park Service) o Jones Beach State Park, Parkway and Causeway System, Hempstead/Oyster Bay, New York o Robert Moses State Park in Babylon/Islip, New York o Fire Island Lighthouse in Fire Island National Seashore, Islip, New York (National Park Service)1 o Fire Island Light Station Historic District in Fire Island National Seashore, Islip, New York (National Park Service) o Carrington House in Fire Island National Seashore, Brook Haven, New York (National Park Service) o Point O'Woods Historic District in Islip, New York o Romer Shoal Light Station in Lower New York Bay, New Jersey o Sandy Hook Light in Gateway National Recreation Area, Middleton, New Jersey (National Park Service) o Fort Hancock, U.S. Life Saving Station in Gateway National Recreation Area, Highlands, New Jersey (National Park Service) o Allenhurst Residential Historic District in Allenhurst, New Jersey o Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association District in Ocean Grove, New Jersey 1 While the Fire Island Lighthouse and Fire Island Light Station Historic District are discussed as one property in COP Volume 3, Appendix Z (Empire 2022), BOEM recognizes Fire Island Lighthouse to have been individually listed in the NRHP under National Register No. 81000082 in 1981, before an update under National Register No. 09001288 created Fire Island Light Station Historic District with an expanded boundary and additional contributing elements in 2010. As such, the lighthouse and historic district are considered separately in Appendix N and impacts are considered for the two properties separately here. N-1

Empire Offshore Wind Appendix N Draft Environmental Impact Statement Finding of Adverse Effect for Empire Wind COP o Water Witch (Monmouth Hills) Historic District in Middleton, New Jersey The Projects are considered to have adverse effects on these cultural resources, which are historic properties presently listed or potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP. The Projects would introduce physical effects from construction on marine cultural resources (i.e., marine archaeological resources and ancient submerged landforms). A total of 30 marine archaeological resources and 22 ancient submerged landforms within the marine archaeological portion of the APE cannot be avoided by the Proposed Action, as offshore Project components and associated work zones are proposed for locations within the defined areas of these resources. No known terrestrial archaeological resources are anticipated to experience physical adverse effects. Finally, the Projects would also introduce visual and add cumulative effects from offshore Project component visibility on 16 architectural resources where ocean views are character-defining features that contribute to their NRHP eligibility. For compliance with NHPA Section 110(f) at 36 CFR 800.10, which applies specifically to NHL properties, BOEM has identified four NHLs in the visual APE: Green-Wood Cemetery, Cyclone Roller Coaster, Fort Hancock the Sandy Hook Proving Ground Historic District, and Sandy Hook Light (COP Volume 3, Appendix Z; Empire 2022). BOEM has determined that one NHL owned by the National Park Service, Sandy Hook Light, would be adversely affected by the Projects. BOEM elected to use the NEPA substitution process for Section 106 purposes, as described in 36 CFR 800.8(c), during its review. The regulations at 36 CFR 800.8(c) provide for use of the NEPA substitution process to fulfill a federal agency's NHPA Section 106 review obligations in lieu of the procedures set forth in 36 CFR 800.3 through 800.6. The NEPA substitution process is described at http://www.achp.gov/integrating_nepa_106. Both processes allow participation of consulting parties. Consistent with use of the NEPA substitution process to fulfill Section 106 requirements, BOEM has decided to codify the resolution of adverse effects through a Memorandum of Agreement pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c)(4)(i)(B). See Attachment A. N.1. Project Overview In September 2020, BOEM received a COP from Empire proposing offshore wind energy projects within Renewable Energy Lease Area OCS-A 0512, offshore New York and New Jersey. In addition, Empire submitted updates to the COP in April 2021, June 2021, July 2021, September 2021, November 2021, December 2021, January 2022, and June 2022. In the COP, Empire proposes construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning of 816-MW (EW 1) and 1,260-MW (EW 2) wind energy projects (the Projects) consisting of offshore WTGs and their foundations, OSS and their foundations, scour protection for foundations, interarray cables linking the individual turbines to the OSS, substation interconnector cables linking the substations to each other, offshore export cables and an onshore export cable system, onshore substations, and connections to the existing electrical grid in New York and New Jersey (see Figure N-1). At their nearest points, WTG and OSS components of the Projects would be approximately 12 nm (14 statutory miles, 22 kilometers) south of Long Island, New York and 16.9 nm (19.5 statutory miles, 31.4 kilometers) east of Long Branch, New Jersey. Offshore Project elements would be on the OCS, with the exception of a portion of the offshore export cables within state waters. Empire is utilizing a PDE in the COP, which represents a reasonable range of design parameters that may be used for the Projects. In reviewing the COP, BOEM is analyzing the maximum-case scenario that could occur from any combination of the contemplated parameters in the PDE. BOEM's analysis and review may result in the approval of a project that is constructed within that range of design parameters. See Appendix E, Project Design Envelope and Maximum-Case Scenario, for more information. Separately from the Proposed Action, NYCEDC has filed a joint permit application to USACE and NYSDEC for planned improvements at SBMT (NYCEDC 2021). The SBMT would be used as an O&M facility to support EW 1 and EW 2 (Figure N-2). Because improvements to SBMT are solely intended to N-2

Empire Offshore Wind Appendix N Draft Environmental Impact Statement Finding of Adverse Effect for Empire Wind COP support Empire's near-term use of SBMT for laydown and staging of WTG components and these improvements are needed in order for the Projects to be constructed, the Draft EIS analyzes NYCEDC's planned improvements to SBMT as a connected action under NEPA, and as part of the entire undertaking under Section 106 (see Section N.1.2). If approved by BOEM and other agencies with authority to approve Project components outside of BOEM's jurisdiction, Empire would be allowed to construct and operate WTGs, an export cable to shore, and associated facilities, including those outside BOEM's jurisdiction, for a specified term. BOEM is now conducting its environmental and technical reviews of the COP and the connected action; the decision regarding approval of the plan is provided in this Draft EIS. A detailed description of the proposed Projects can be found in Chapter 2, Section 2.1.2, of this Draft EIS. This Draft EIS considers reasonably foreseeable impacts of the Projects, including impacts on cultural resources, including historic properties. N-3

Empire Offshore Wind Appendix N Draft Environmental Impact Statement Finding of Adverse Effect for Empire Wind COP N.1.1 Background The Projects are within a commercial lease area that has received previous Section 106 review by BOEM regarding the issuance of the commercial lease and approval of site assessment activities and are subject to two prior Programmatic Agreements. In 2012, BOEM executed a Programmatic Agreement among the SHPOs of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia, the ACHP, the Narragansett Indian Tribe, and the Shinnecock Indian Nation (see https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/renewable-energy-program/ State-Activities/HP/MidAtlantic-PA_Executed.pdf). Additionally, in 2016, BOEM executed a Programmatic Agreement among the SHPOs of New York and New Jersey, and ACHP to consider renewable energy activities offshore New York and New Jersey2 (see https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/ files/renewable-energy-program/State-Activities/HP/NY-NJ-Programmatic-Agreement-Executed.pdf). In June 2016, BOEM prepared an environmental assessment to analyze the environmental impacts associated with issuing commercial wind leases and approving site assessment activities within the New York WEA. In December 2016, Statoil Wind US, LLC (subsequently renamed to Equinor Wind US, LLC in 2018) submitted an application for all 79,350 acres (32,112 hectares) of lease OCS-A 0512. BOEM approved this lease on December 16, 2016. Equinor Wind US, LLC assigned the lease to Empire on January 27, 2021, in accordance with BOEM's requirements. Therefore, the COP and associated attachments refer to Empire as the lease holder. Empire's COP proposed to develop the Lease Area as two wind farms, known as EW 1 and EW 2 (collectively referred to hereafter as the Projects). EW 1 and EW 2 would be electrically isolated and independent from each other. The Projects would consist of up to 147 WTGs extending up to 951 feet (290 meters) above MLLW. EW 1 would consist of approximately 57 WTGs and EW 2 would consist of approximately 90 WTGs. Empire would mount the WTGs on monopile or piled jacket foundations. The proposed facility includes up to two OSS, which would be built either on monopile or piled jacket foundations. Where required, scour protection would be placed around foundations to stabilize the seabed near the foundations as well as the foundations themselves. Array cables would transfer electrical energy generated by the WTGs to the OSS. OSS would include step-up transformers and other electrical equipment needed to connect the interarray cables to the offshore export cables.
