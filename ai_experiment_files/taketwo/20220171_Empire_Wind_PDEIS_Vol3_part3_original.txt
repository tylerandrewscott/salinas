Nearby view receptor locations may vary from screened to open views of the wind farm. 2 Based on ArcGIS viewshed analysis. Proposed Action contrasts in the characteristic seascape and landscape, as perceived in views from each KOP, are based on visual simulations for eight representative KOPs (Appendix D to COP Volume 3, Appendix AA; Empire 2022). Open ocean unit view contrasts are estimated based on similar open view conditions in ocean environments. Landscape and seascape compatibility and photography conditions for each viewpoint are presented in COP Volume 3, Appendix AA, Table 9.1 (Empire 2022). The landscape and seascape evaluation scale ranges from faint, apparent, conspicuous, and prominent to dominant. No onshore substation viewpoints other than EW 2 Substation C viewpoints would result in either prominent or dominant conditions. Offshore potential viewpoints' evaluations range from faint to dominant. Visual contrast determinations involve comparisons of characteristics of the seascape and landscape before and after Proposed Action implementation. The range of potential contrasts includes strong, moderate, weak, and none. The strongest daytime contrasts would result from tranquil and flat seas combined with sunlit WTG towers, nacelles, rotating and flickering rotors, rotor shadow flicker, and the yellow tower 50-foot (15.2-meter) base color against a dark background sky and an undifferentiated foreground. The weakest daytime contrasts would result from turbulent seas combined with overcast daylight conditions on WTG towers, nacelles, and rotors again an overcast background sky and a foreground modulated by varied landscape elements. The strongest nighttime contrasts would result from dark skies (absent moonlight) combined with navigation lights, activated lighting on the OSS, mid-tower lights, and Project lighting M-15

The weakest nighttime contrasts would result from moonlit, cloudless skies, tranquil (reflective) seas, ADLS activation, and only mid-tower lights. Photographic comparisons of characteristics of the seascape's and landscape's existing conditions and Proposed Action implementation are included in COP Volume 3, Appendix AA (Empire 2022) for eight of the 17 KOPs in the following summary tables.
